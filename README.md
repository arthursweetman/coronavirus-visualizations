# coronavirus-visualizations

## Overview

This is a repository containing several visuals which explain the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).
The data used in these visualizations was obtained from the public GitHub repository provided by John Hopkins CSSE. See repository [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

## Before you Start

Take a look at the visualizations and the code that created these visualizations inside this repository first. If you would like to download, run, and/or edit the code yourself, please follow the steps below.

## Getting Started
1. Clone GitHub repository containing John Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 data from [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
2. Clone this repository. The files in the previous repository and this repository can all be in the same folder, if you'd like.
3. Open "virus_spread.R" and "virus_map.R" in RStudio.
4. In each of these files, immediately after the `library()` statements, change the file paths to match the appropriate location of the file on your own computer.
  * The dataset containing the confirmed number of cases of COVID-19 is contained in the John Hopkins CSSE GitHub GitHub repository path: **"csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv"**
  * The dataset containing the confirmed number of deaths resulting from COVID-19 is contained in the John Hopkins CSSE GitHub repository path: **"csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Deaths.csv"**
5. Run code and view output.
